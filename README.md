# Build-Propensity-to-Purchase-Model-in-Python

# Business Objective

Our Client is an early-stage e-commerce company selling various products from daily
essentials (such as Dairy & vegetables) to high-end electronics and home appliances. It
is a one-year-old company and they are witnessing many people coming to their
platform and searching for products but only a few end up purchasing.

To increase the number of purchases, the business is planning to send discounts or
coupons to users to motivate them to buy. But since it is an early-stage startup, they
have only limited funds for this discount campaign. So, they have reached out to us
seeking our help in building a model that would predict the purchase probability of each
user in buying a product.

We will be making use of propensity modeling for this. Propensity modeling is a set of
approaches to building predictive models to forecast the behavior of a target audience
by analyzing their past behaviors. That is to say, propensity models help identify the
likelihood of someone performing a certain action. We can then use this likelihood or
probability score to create personalized targeting campaigns for the users thus reducing
our total cost (targeting only a small set of users) and increasing our ROI.

To help us in predicting the propensity of purchase, we will also make use of RFM
Modeling. RFM is a data-driven customer segmentation technique that allows marketers
to make informed decisions. RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value,
each corresponding to some key customer trait. These RFM metrics are important
indicators of a customer’s behavior because the frequency and monetary value affect a
customer’s lifetime value, and recency affects retention, a measure of engagement.

It empowers marketers to quickly identify and segment users into homogeneous groups
and target them with differentiated and personalized marketing strategies. This in turn
improves user engagement and retention. With the probability scores from propensity
modeling, the marketing team can filter only those users who need the actual push (in
terms of discounts or coupons) to make a purchase rather than sending coupons to
users who would have bought the product anyway.
